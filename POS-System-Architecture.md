# Retail POS System Architecture

## System Overview

A comprehensive React Native/Expo POS application with Supabase backend, designed for retail operations with full inventory management, sales tracking, and customer management capabilities.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React Native** with **Expo** for cross-platform mobile development
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React Navigation** for navigation
- **React Query** for data fetching and caching
- **React Hook Form** for form management
- **NativeBase** or **Tamagui** for UI components
- **Expo Camera** for barcode scanning
- **React Native Bluetooth** for hardware integration

### Backend
- **Supabase** for database, authentication, and real-time features
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Supabase Auth** for authentication
- **Supabase Storage** for file storage
- **Supabase Edge Functions** for serverless functions

### Payment & Hardware Integration
- **Stripe** for card payments
- **Bluetooth APIs** for receipt printers and cash drawers
- **Camera API** for barcode scanning
- **Native device APIs** for payment terminal integration
